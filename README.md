## Introduction

**Team Tech Titans** from Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun presents **Pravaah** - a comprehensive AI-powered document intelligence system built specifically for Indian government offices.

### The Problem We Witnessed

Over 45 days of intensive development and field research across Uttarakhand, we interviewed 12 government officers from Dehradun to Pithoragarh. What we discovered was a systemic crisis hiding in plain sight.

<div align="center">

### Watch: The Ground Reality

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75606e24-1c68-494d-9e63-002d0123610a

*Government officers describe the daily challenge of managing 150+ documents while maintaining efficiency and accuracy*

</div>

### What We Built

Pravaah is not another document management system. It is an intelligent workflow automation platform that combines:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Google Gemini-powered summarization that converts 40-page documents into 2-minute actionable summaries
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic department detection and intelligent document routing based on content analysis
- **Blockchain Verification**: Immutable audit trails on Polygon network ensuring complete transparency
- **Role-Based Access**: Four distinct user interfaces tailored for Super Admins, Department Admins, Officers, and Auditors

### Why This Matters

When a flash flood warning arrives at a district headquarters mixed with 150 other documents, every minute of delay can cost lives. When a medical emergency fund request sits unread for three days because it looks like routine paperwork, families suffer. When crop insurance approvals miss the planting season due to manual processing backlogs, livelihoods are destroyed.

Pravaah addresses these critical failures in government document workflow with technology that understands context, prioritizes urgency, and ensures accountability.

### Our Approach

This is not a theoretical solution. Every feature in Pravaah emerged from real conversations with government officers who shared their frustrations, their workarounds, and their hopes for better systems. We built for:

- **Unreliable internet connectivity** in remote areas
- **Low technical literacy** among government staff
- **Bilingual requirements** (Hindi and English)
- **Legacy integration** with existing government systems
- **Zero-trust security** with blockchain verification

### The Impact Vision

Our prototype processes documents 180 times faster than manual methods. Deployed across Uttarakhand, Pravaah could save 12,000+ officer hours monthly. Scaled nationally across 28 states and 8 union territories, it could transform how 100,000+ government officers serve 1.4 billion citizens.

## Problem Statement

### The Reality of Government Document Management

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/Current Scene 1.png" alt="Government office chaos" width="700" style="border-radius: 20px; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
  <br/><br/>
  <img src="src/img/Current Scene 2.png" alt="Document stacks" width="700" style="border-radius: 20px; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
  <br/><br/>
  <img src="src/img/Current Scene 3.png" alt="Manual processing" width="700" style="border-radius: 20px; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/>
</div>

**This is not just bureaucracy. This is a system struggling to function.**

### The Numbers Behind the Chaos

| Reality | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **150+ documents/day** per officer | Officers spend 6 hours just reading documents |
| **Files stacked 3 feet high** on desks | Critical documents lost in the pile |
| **Every document marked "URGENT"** | Real emergencies get delayed |
| **Manual routing takes 3-5 days** | Disaster warnings delayed by hours |
| **Zero audit trail** | No accountability, RTI requests take months |

### Why This Problem Matters

This is not about making government slightly more efficient. **When paperwork delays disaster warnings, lives are at stake.**

**Real-world scenarios:**

**Flash Flood Warning in Chamoli**  
A cloudburst alert arrives via email. It is buried among 150 other emails. By the time an officer reads it, villages are already flooded. Every minute counts in mountainous regions where warnings need to reach remote areas fast.

**Medical Emergency Fund Request**  
A family needs 2 lakh rupees urgently for surgery. The approval file sits unread for 3 days because the officer is dealing with routine budget circulars. The delay could have been avoided with automatic prioritization.

**Farmer Subsidy During Planting Season**  
Crop insurance claims pile up during monsoon. Officers manually read hundreds of applications. By the time approvals come, the planting window is missed. Livelihoods are lost.

**Legal Notice with 48-Hour Deadline**  
A court order arrives mixed with routine files. No automatic flagging. Officer misses the deadline. Department faces contempt of court.

### Who Is Affected?

1. **Government Officers**: Overwhelmed, working late nights, wanting to serve but drowning in paperwork
2. **Citizens**: Waiting weeks for approvals that should take days
3. **Emergency Services**: Delayed responses during disasters
4. **The System**: Loss of public trust in government efficiency

---

## Users & Use Cases

### Our Target Users

Pravaah is **NOT** a citizen-facing portal. It is designed for government officers and administrators who process documents daily.

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/our_users.png" alt="Our Users" width="800" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);"/>
</div>

### The Four User Roles

#### 1. Super Admin (State-Level Oversight)

**Who they are**: Chief Secretary's office, IT Department heads

**What they do**:
- Create and manage all government departments
- Oversee system-wide statistics and performance
- Configure routing rules and workflows
- Manage user accounts across all departments
- Access complete audit logs

**Use Case**: The Uttarakhand IT Department uses Super Admin access to onboard new districts, monitor document processing times across the state, and generate monthly reports for the Chief Secretary.

#### 2. Department Admin (Departmental Management)

**Who they are**: Head of Agriculture Department, Director of Health Services, etc.

**What they do**:
- Manage users within their department
- Configure department-specific routing rules
- Set up approval workflows
- Monitor departmental document statistics
- Handle interdepartmental coordination

**Use Case**: The Agriculture Department Admin sets up a rule: "All documents containing 'crop insurance' automatically route to Claims Section, documents about 'fertilizer subsidy' go to Distribution Section."

#### 3. Officer (The Frontline Worker)

**Who they are**: Section Officers, Under Secretaries, Field Officers

**What they do**:
- Upload documents with metadata
- Review AI-generated summaries
- Approve, reject, or forward documents
- Add comments and notes
- Track document status in real-time

**Use Case**: A District Revenue Officer uploads a land dispute file. AI generates a summary showing: "Land dispute between 2 parties, Plot number 142, Tehri district, 45 lakh rupees valuation, requires legal department review." The system automatically routes it to Legal Department and notifies the concerned officer.

#### 4. Auditor (Transparency & Accountability)

**Who they are**: RTI officers, internal audit teams, accountability watchdogs

**What they do**:
- View complete audit trails
- Track document movement history
- Verify blockchain records
- Generate compliance reports

**Use Case**: An RTI request asks: "Why did File XYZ take 15 days?" The Auditor pulls the blockchain trail showing: Uploaded on Jan 1, sat unread for 10 days, then processed in 5 days. Complete transparency.

### Key Use Cases

| Scenario | Traditional Way | With Pravaah |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Land Acquisition File (40 pages)** | Officer reads 40 pages (2 hours), manually writes summary, physically routes to Legal Dept (3-5 days) | AI summary in 30 seconds, auto-routed to Legal Dept in 1 minute |
| **Flash Flood Alert** | Mixed with 150 emails, read sequentially, delayed by hours | Detected as HIGH PRIORITY, routed to Disaster Management + Revenue + DM instantly |
| **Routine Circular** | Takes same time as critical documents | Auto-flagged as LOW priority, officer can review later |
| **Budget Approval** | File moves between 5 departments manually (2 weeks) | Smart routing to all departments simultaneously, blockchain tracking |

---

## Existing Solutions

### How It Is "Solved" Today

Let's be honest: It is not solved. It is managed. Barely.

#### Scenario 1: The Manual Marathon

**How it works now**:
1. Land dispute file arrives, Officer reads 25 pages
2. Writes summary by hand, Calls peon
3. File physically walks to Legal Department
4. Logged in physical register, Cycle repeats

**Time**: 3-5 days (+ 1 week if officer on leave)

#### Scenario 2: The Email Chaos

**How it works now**:
- 150 emails/day, Each with 2-3 PDFs, Each PDF 10-20 pages
- No categorization, Hours spent opening files to see what is inside
- **Result**: Important emails buried, urgent matters delayed

#### Scenario 3: The "Urgent" Stamp Problem

**How it works now**:
- Everything marked URGENT, Nothing is actually urgent
- Flash flood warnings look like routine files
- *"10-15 urgent docs daily. By the time we realize one is critical, hours have passed."* — Chamoli District Official

### Existing "Solutions" and Their Gaps

| Solution | What It Tries to Do | Why It Fails |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Email + PDF Attachments** | Digital delivery | Zero categorization, no prioritization, inbox chaos |
| **Physical File Management** | Traditional system | Slow, loses documents, zero audit trail |
| **Basic DMS (Document Management Systems)** | Store documents digitally | Just a filing cabinet—no intelligence, no automation |
| **Manual Routing Registers** | Track file movement | Paper-based, no real-time updates, easily tampered |

### The Core Gap: No Intelligence

All existing solutions treat documents like dumb files. They store them, maybe search them, but they do not **understand** them.

**What is missing**:
- No AI to read and summarize
- No automatic routing based on content
- No priority detection
- No transparency or audit trail
- Not built for India's ground reality (bilingual needs, low-tech literacy, unreliable internet)

---

## Our Solution

### Introducing Pravaah: Document Intelligence That Actually Works

**Pravaah** is not just another document management system. It is an **AI-powered document intelligence platform** built specifically for the reality of Indian government offices.

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/image1 copy.jpeg" alt="Pravaah Interface" width="800" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);"/>
</div>

### What Makes Pravaah Different?

#### 1. Instant AI Summarization

**Traditional way**: Officer reads 40 pages, 2 hours wasted

**Pravaah way**:
- Upload 40-page document, 30 seconds later:

> *"Land acquisition request for 12.5 hectares in Tehri. 4.2 crore rupees compensation. 47 families affected. Environmental clearance pending. Requires: Finance approval, Environmental clearance verification, Legal review."*

**Powered by**: Google Gemini AI trained on Indian government document formats

**What it extracts**:
- Key stakeholders and departments involved
- Action items and approvals needed
- Deadlines and time-sensitive information
- Financial implications
- Legal requirements

#### 2. Smart Auto-Routing

**Traditional way**: Officer manually decides routing, 10-15 minutes per document

**Pravaah way**:

| Document Type | Auto-Detection | Smart Routing |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Flash flood alert** | Keywords: "flood", "disaster", "Uttarkashi" | Disaster Management + Revenue Dept + District Magistrate (HIGH priority) |
| **Crop insurance claim** | Keywords: "insurance", "crop damage", "subsidy" | Agriculture Dept, Claims Section (MEDIUM priority) |
| **Legal notice** | Keywords: "court", "notice", "hearing date" | Legal Dept (HIGH priority if deadline < 7 days) |
| **Routine circular** | Generic administrative content | All departments (LOW priority) |

**Time saved**: Routing happens in **under 60 seconds** vs. 3-5 days manually.

#### 3. Blockchain Audit Trail

Every action is recorded on **Polygon blockchain**:

```
Upload: 9:15 AM, Dec 15, Officer Sharma
AI Summary: 9:15 AM (30 seconds)
Routed: 9:16 AM, Finance Dept
Viewed: 10:30 AM, Finance Officer Gupta
Approved: 11:45 AM, Finance Officer Gupta
Final Approval: 2:20 PM, Dept Head Verma
```

**Why blockchain?**
- **Immutable**: No one can change history
- **Transparent**: RTI requests answered in minutes
- **Accountable**: Know exactly where delays happened

#### 4. Priority Intelligence

AI does not just summarize—it **understands urgency**.

| Priority Level | Criteria | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Deadlines < 7 days, disaster keywords, court orders | Flash flood warning, legal notice |
| **MEDIUM** | Budget approvals, subsidy claims | Crop insurance, fund requests |
| **LOW** | Routine circulars, informational docs | Policy updates, meeting minutes |

#### 5. Role-Based Dashboards

Each user sees exactly what they need:

**Super Admin**: System-wide stats, user management, configuration  
**Department Admin**: Departmental workflow, team performance  
**Officer**: My documents, pending actions, AI summaries  
**Auditor**: Complete audit trails, compliance reports

### How It Works: Complete Document Lifecycle

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/diagram1.png" alt="Workflow Diagram" width="800" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 8px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);"/>
</div>

```
1. UPLOAD
   Officer uploads document with basic metadata
   ↓
2. AI PROCESSING (30 seconds)
   Google Gemini extracts: summary, entities, action items
   ↓
3. SMART ROUTING (< 1 minute)
   System detects relevant departments and routes automatically
   ↓
4. NOTIFICATION
   Email alerts sent to assigned officers
   ↓
5. REVIEW & ACTION
   Officer reads AI summary, takes action (approve/reject/forward)
   ↓
6. BLOCKCHAIN LOGGING
   Every step recorded on Polygon
   ↓
7. REAL-TIME UPDATES
   Dashboard shows live status
```

**Total time: Upload to routing = Under 2 minutes** (vs. 3-5 days traditionally)

- **MetaMask wallet** with Polygon Amoy testnet MATIC ([Get from faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/))
- **Google Gemini API key** ([Get free tier](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))
- **Gmail account** for sending notification emails

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gov-docflow-ai.git
cd gov-docflow-ai
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `.env` file in backend directory:

```env
# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/pravah_prototype

# JWT Secrets
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_change_in_production
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret_key_change_in_production

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@pravah.gov.in
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password

# Google Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Blockchain
BLOCKCHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY=your_metamask_private_key

# Server
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development
```

Seed database with initial data:

```bash
node seed.js
```

Start backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:5001`

### Step 3: Blockchain Setup

```bash
cd blockchain
npm install
```

Deploy smart contract:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

**Important**: Copy the contract address from deployment output and paste it into backend `.env` file under `BLOCKCHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

### Step 4: Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ..  # Back to root directory
npm install
```

Create `.env` file in root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001

### Why We Chose Each Technology

#### Frontend: React 18.2 + Redux + TailwindCSS

**Why React?**
- Component-based architecture perfect for role-specific dashboards
- Large community and ecosystem
- Easy to maintain and scale

**Why Redux?**
- Complex state management across multiple user roles
- Predictable state updates
- DevTools for debugging

**Why TailwindCSS?**

**Why Node.js?**
- JavaScript everywhere (same language as frontend)
- Excellent async handling for document processing
- Large package ecosystem (npm)

**Why Express?**
- Minimalist, flexible framework
- Middleware support for auth, logging, etc.
- Battle-tested in production

**Why MongoDB?**
- Flexible schema for diverse document types
- Excellent for storing metadata and summaries
- Scalable with MongoDB Atlas

#### AI: Google Gemini

**Why Gemini?**
- Superior natural language understanding

- Multi-language support (Hindi + English)

**Alternatives considered**: OpenAI GPT-4 (expensive), Claude (less accurate for Indian context)

#### Blockchain: Polygon + Solidity

**Why Polygon?**
- Lower gas fees than Ethereum
- Faster transactions (2-second block time)
- EVM-compatible (easy migration from Ethereum)

**Why not other chains?**
- Ethereum mainnet: Too expensive for government use
- Private blockchain: Defeats purpose of transparency

#### Authentication: JWT

**Why JWT?**
- Stateless authentication
- Refresh tokens for security
- Easy integration with React
