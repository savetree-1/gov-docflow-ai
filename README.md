## Introduction

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/Intro Banner.png" alt="Pravaah Introduction" width="100%" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);"/>

</div>

Hey there! We're **Team Tech Titans** from **Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun** — four third-year computer science students who spent **45 days** building something we genuinely believe can change how government works in India.

This isn't just a hackathon project we threw together in a weekend. This is **<span style="color: #0066cc;">Pravaah</span>** (प्रवाह - meaning "flow" in Hindi), born from frustration, late nights, and a deep desire to solve a problem we saw every day growing up in **Uttarakhand**.

### How It Started

Picture this: A government officer sits at a desk buried under **47 physical files**. Each file contains **20-40 pages**. Every single page needs to be read, understood, categorized, and routed to the right department. Meanwhile, emails keep flooding in with more PDFs. Somewhere in that chaos, there's a **flash flood warning** that needs immediate attention — but it looks exactly like every other "URGENT" document.

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/image1 copy.jpeg" alt="Government Officer Reality" width="700" style="border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);"/>
</div>

<br/>

We spoke to **12 government officers** across Uttarakhand — from Dehradun to Pithoragarh, from district headquarters to remote tehsils. Every single one told us the same story: **"We want to serve citizens efficiently, but we're drowning in paperwork."**

That's when we knew: This isn't a technology problem waiting for a solution. This is a **human problem** that technology can actually fix.

### What We Aimed to Achieve

Build an **AI-powered document intelligence system** that:
- **Summarizes** 40-page documents into 2-minute reads
- **Routes** documents automatically to the right departments
- **Prioritizes** urgent matters intelligently
- **Tracks** everything on blockchain for transparency
- Works in the **real conditions** of Indian government offices (unreliable internet, low-tech literacy, bilingual needs)

**We built it. It works. And we're proud of it.**

## Problem Statement

### The Reality of Government Document Management

When someone says "government office" or "sarkari daftar," you probably think of this:

<div align="center">

**Watch the Chaos Unfold:**

  <p><strong>Scene 3: Delays & Frustration</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**This isn't just bureaucracy. This is a system struggling to function.**

### The Numbers Behind the Chaos

| Reality | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **150+ documents/day** per officer | Officers spend **6 hours** just reading documents |
| **Files stacked 3 feet high** on desks | Critical documents **lost in the pile** |
| **Every document marked "URGENT"** | Real emergencies get **delayed** |
| **Manual routing takes 3-5 days** | Disaster warnings **delayed by hours** |
| **Zero audit trail** | No accountability, RTI requests take **months** |

### Why This Problem Matters

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgzoKnwFNmISR8I/giphy.gif" width="300"/>
</div>

This isn't about making government slightly more efficient. **When paperwork delays disaster warnings, lives are at stake.**

**Real-world scenarios:**

**Flash Flood Warning in Chamoli**  
A cloudburst alert arrives via email. It's buried among 150 other emails. By the time an officer reads it, villages are already flooded. Every minute counts in mountainous regions where warnings need to reach remote areas fast.

**Medical Emergency Fund Request**  
A family needs ₹2 lakh urgently for surgery. The approval file sits unread for **3 days** because the officer is dealing with routine budget circulars. The delay could have been avoided with automatic prioritization.

**Farmer Subsidy During Planting Season**  
Crop insurance claims pile up during monsoon. Officers manually read hundreds of applications. By the time approvals come, the planting window is missed. **Livelihoods are lost.**

**Legal Notice with 48-Hour Deadline**  
A court order arrives mixed with routine files. No automatic flagging. Officer misses the deadline. Department faces **contempt of court.**

### Who Is Affected?

1. **Government Officers**: Overwhelmed, working late nights, wanting to serve but drowning in paperwork
2. **Citizens**: Waiting weeks for approvals that should take days
3. **Emergency Services**: Delayed responses during disasters
4. **The System**: Loss of public trust in government efficiency

## Users & Use Cases

### Wait—Who Actually Uses Pravaah?

**Spoiler: Not Citizens**

Pravaah is **NOT** a citizen-facing portal. It's for the people *inside* government offices — the ones dealing with mountains of documents daily. Government officers themselves are drowning. They want to serve efficiently but are stuck reading hundreds of pages and manually routing files.

<div align="center">
  <img src="src/img/our_users.png" alt="Government Officers" width="800" style="border-radius: 20px; box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);"/>
</div>

### The Four User Roles

#### 1. **Super Admin** (State-Level Oversight)

**Who they are**: Chief Secretary's office, IT Department heads

**What they do**:
- Create and manage all government departments
- Oversee system-wide statistics and performance
- Configure routing rules and workflows
- Manage user accounts across all departments
- Access complete audit logs

**Use Case**: The Uttarakhand IT Department uses Super Admin access to onboard new districts, monitor document processing times across the state, and generate monthly reports for the Chief Secretary.

#### 2. **Department Admin** (Departmental Management)

**Who they are**: Head of Agriculture Department, Director of Health Services, etc.

**What they do**:
- Manage users within their department
- Configure department-specific routing rules
- Set up approval workflows
- Monitor departmental document statistics
- Handle interdepartmental coordination

**Use Case**: The Agriculture Department Admin sets up a rule: "All documents containing 'crop insurance' automatically route to Claims Section, documents about 'fertilizer subsidy' go to Distribution Section."

#### 3. **Officer** (The Frontline Worker)

**Who they are**: Section Officers, Under Secretaries, Field Officers

**What they do**:
- Upload documents with metadata
- Review AI-generated summaries
- Approve, reject, or forward documents
- Add comments and notes
- Track document status in real-time

**Use Case**: A District Revenue Officer uploads a land dispute file. AI generates a summary showing: "Land dispute between 2 parties, Plot #142, Tehri district, ₹45 lakh valuation, requires legal department review." The system automatically routes it to Legal Department and notifies the concerned officer.

#### 4. **Auditor** (Transparency & Accountability)

**Who they are**: RTI officers, internal audit teams, accountability watchdogs

**What they do**:
- View complete audit trails
- Track document movement history
- Verify blockchain records
- Generate compliance reports

**Use Case**: An RTI request asks: "Why did File #XYZ take 15 days?" The Auditor pulls the blockchain trail showing: Uploaded on Jan 1, sat unread for 10 days, then processed in 5 days. Complete transparency.

### Key Use Cases

| Scenario | Traditional Way | With Pravaah |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Land Acquisition File (40 pages)** | Officer reads 40 pages (2 hours), manually writes summary, physically routes to Legal Dept (3-5 days) | AI summary in **30 seconds**, auto-routed to Legal Dept in **1 minute** |
| **Flash Flood Alert** | Mixed with 150 emails, read sequentially, delayed by hours | Detected as **HIGH PRIORITY**, routed to Disaster Management + Revenue + DM **instantly** |
| **Routine Circular** | Takes same time as critical documents | Auto-flagged as **LOW priority**, officer can review later |
| **Budget Approval** | File moves between 5 departments manually (2 weeks) | Smart routing to all departments **simultaneously**, blockchain tracking |

## Existing Solutions

### How It's "Solved" Today

Let's be honest: It's not solved. It's managed. Barely.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btPCcdNniyf0ArS/giphy.gif" width="300"/>
</div>

#### Scenario 1: The Manual Marathon

**How it works now**:
1. Land dispute file arrives → Officer reads 25 pages
2. Writes summary by hand → Calls peon
3. File physically walks to Legal Department
4. Logged in physical register → Cycle repeats

**Time**: **3-5 days** (+ 1 week if officer on leave)

#### Scenario 2: The Email Chaos

**How it works now**:
- 150 emails/day → Each with 2-3 PDFs → Each PDF 10-20 pages
- No categorization → Hours spent opening files to see what's inside
- **Result**: Important emails buried, urgent matters delayed

#### Scenario 3: The "Urgent" Stamp Problem

**How it works now**:
- Everything marked URGENT → Nothing is actually urgent
- Flash flood warnings look like routine files
- *"10-15 urgent docs daily. By the time we realize one is critical, hours have passed."* — Chamoli District Official

### Existing "Solutions" and Their Gaps

| Solution | What It Tries to Do | Why It Fails |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Email + PDF Attachments** | Digital delivery | Zero categorization, no prioritization, inbox chaos |
| **Physical File Management** | Traditional system | Slow, loses documents, zero audit trail |
| **Basic DMS (Document Management Systems)** | Store documents digitally | Just a filing cabinet—no intelligence, no automation |
| **Manual Routing Registers** | Track file movement | Paper-based, no real-time updates, easily tampered |

### The Core Gap: No Intelligence

All existing solutions treat documents like dumb files. They store them, maybe search them, but they don't **understand** them.

**What's missing**:
- No AI to read and summarize
- No automatic routing based on content
- No priority detection
- No transparency or audit trail
- Not built for India's ground reality (bilingual needs, low-tech literacy, unreliable internet)

### What Makes Pravaah Different?

#### 1. **Instant AI Summarization**

**Traditional way**: Officer reads 40 pages → **2 hours wasted**

**Pravaah way**:
- Upload 40-page document → **30 seconds** later:

> *"Land acquisition request for 12.5 hectares in Tehri. ₹4.2 crore compensation. 47 families affected. Environmental clearance pending. Requires: Finance approval, Environmental clearance verification, Legal review."*

**Powered by**: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/" style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Google Gemini AI</strong></a> trained on Indian government document formats

**What it extracts**:
- Key stakeholders and departments involved
- Action items and approvals needed
- Deadlines and time-sensitive information
- Financial implications
- Legal requirements

#### 2. **Smart Auto-Routing**

**Traditional way**: Officer manually decides routing → **10-15 minutes** per document

**Pravaah way**:

| Document Type | Auto-Detection | Smart Routing |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Flash flood alert** | Keywords: "flood", "disaster", "Uttarkashi" | → Disaster Management + Revenue Dept + District Magistrate (**HIGH** priority) |
| **Crop insurance claim** | Keywords: "insurance", "crop damage", "subsidy" | → Agriculture Dept → Claims Section (**MEDIUM** priority) |
| **Legal notice** | Keywords: "court", "notice", "hearing date" | → Legal Dept (**HIGH** priority if deadline < 7 days) |
| **Routine circular** | Generic administrative content | → All departments (**LOW** priority) |

**Time saved**: Routing happens in **under 60 seconds** vs. 3-5 days manually.

#### 3. **Blockchain Audit Trail**

Every action is recorded on **<a href="https://polygon.technology/" style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Polygon blockchain</strong></a>**:

```
Upload: 9:15 AM, Dec 15 → Officer Sharma
AI Summary: 9:15 AM (30 seconds)
Routed: 9:16 AM → Finance Dept
Viewed: 10:30 AM → Finance Officer Gupta
Approved: 11:45 AM → Finance Officer Gupta
Final Approval: 2:20 PM → Dept Head Verma
```

**Why blockchain?**
- **Immutable**: No one can change history
- **Transparent**: RTI requests answered in minutes
- **Accountable**: Know exactly where delays happened

#### 4. **Priority Intelligence**

AI doesn't just summarize—it **understands urgency**.

| Priority Level | Criteria | Example |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Deadlines < 7 days, disaster keywords, court orders | Flash flood warning, legal notice |
| **MEDIUM** | Budget approvals, subsidy claims | Crop insurance, fund requests |
| **LOW** | Routine circulars, informational docs | Policy updates, meeting minutes |

#### 5. **Role-Based Dashboards**

Each user sees exactly what they need:

**Super Admin**: System-wide stats, user management, configuration  
**Department Admin**: Departmental workflow, team performance  
**Officer**: My documents, pending actions, AI summaries  
**Auditor**: Complete audit trails, compliance reports

### How It Works: Complete Document Lifecycle

```
1. UPLOAD
   Officer uploads document with basic metadata
   ↓
2. AI PROCESSING (30 seconds)
   Google Gemini extracts: summary, entities, action items
   ↓
3. SMART ROUTING (< 1 minute)
   System detects relevant departments and routes automatically
   ↓
4. NOTIFICATION
   Email alerts sent to assigned officers
   ↓
5. REVIEW & ACTION
   Officer reads AI summary, takes action (approve/reject/forward)
   ↓
6. BLOCKCHAIN LOGGING
   Every step recorded on Polygon
   ↓
7. REAL-TIME UPDATES
   Dashboard shows live status
```

**Total time: Upload to routing = Under 2 minutes** (vs. 3-5 days traditionally)
